            <p>Based on what you put in, I'd recommend that you look into the Ruby/Rails track. Java and Ruby are both languages that are used to interact with the user, but Ruby is a little more modern. It vibes with coders in startups trying to get off the ground quickly, and create sites with many users.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="php-text" class="text-holder">
            <p>Based on what you put in, I'd recommend that you look into the PHP/Drupal track. If you feel comfortable using a language patched together by various coders, you'll excel with PHP.</p>

          <div id="java-text" class="text-holder">
            <p>Based on what you put in, I'd recommend that you look into the Java/Android track. Java has been around for a while and it looks like it's still here to stay, at least with bigger companies. This track will teach you invaluable skills, in demand for both web and mobile development.</p>

          <div id="c-sharp-text" class="text-holder">
            <p>Based on what you put in, I'd recommend that you look into the C#/.NET track. There's a reason why C# is one of the most-demanded languages on the market, and that's because of its stability. It's not <em>super</em> exciting, but it's traditional in larger businesses.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="css-optional" class="text-holder">
            <p>It's also recommended that you check out the CSS/Design Track, if you want to hone your front-end skills. Here's some more information: </p>
