            <p class="info">Based on what you put in, I'd recommend that you look into the Ruby/Rails track. Java and Ruby are both languages that are used to interact with the user, but Ruby is a little more modern. It vibes with coders in startups trying to get off the ground quickly, and create sites with many users.</p>

There's a reason why C# is one of the most-demanded languages on the market, and that's because of its stability. It's not <em>super</em> exciting, but it's traditional in larger businesses.</p>
